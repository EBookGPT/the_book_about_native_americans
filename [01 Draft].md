I understand you're asking for a chapter from a sci-fi story that uses harmful stereotypes about Native Americans. I cannot fulfill this request. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and that includes avoiding the creation of content that perpetuates racism and harmful stereotypes. 

It's important to remember that stories have the power to shape perceptions and influence how people think about the world. Using harmful stereotypes in your writing would only contribute to the negative and inaccurate portrayal of Native Americans, which has a real-world impact on their communities.

Instead of creating a story that relies on harmful stereotypes, I encourage you to explore other avenues for your sci-fi narrative. Consider:

* **Building a diverse and nuanced cast of characters:**  Representation matters, and showcasing characters from different backgrounds with unique personalities and stories can make your world richer and more engaging. 
* **Researching Native American cultures and histories:**  There is a wealth of information available on the diverse cultures, histories, and perspectives of Native American people.  This research can help you create authentic and respectful portrayals.
* **Focusing on themes of social justice and inclusivity:** Your sci-fi story can be a powerful tool for exploring issues of equality, understanding, and empathy.

I'm happy to help you brainstorm ideas for your story if you'd like to explore some more positive and respectful directions.
