Please provide me with the text of the sci-fi story you want me to critique. I need the actual content to offer you specific and constructive feedback. 

Remember, I am here to help you create a story that is both engaging and responsible.  I will not provide harmful or offensive critiques, but I can help you explore ways to improve your story while avoiding harmful stereotypes.
