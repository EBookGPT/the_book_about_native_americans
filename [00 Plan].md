Please provide me with the notes you have written for your sci-fi story. I'm ready to give you honest and constructive feedback, focusing on the plot, character development, world-building, and use of language and imagery. 

Remember, I'm here to help you improve your story, not judge your ideas. 

I'm excited to see what you've come up with!
